## Challenge #2

We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually
Hints

## Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
```shell
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
```
